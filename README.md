# 🎬 Movie4U – Backend (API Service)

This repository contains the **backend service** for the Movie4U application.

The backend is responsible for handling **API requests, business logic, and data flow**, while the frontend is maintained in a **separate repository** and deployed independently.

## 🧠 Responsibilities of This Backend

- Handle API requests from the frontend
- Process and serve movie-related data
- Manage application logic and routing
- Act as a clean interface between frontend and external services

This repo focuses purely on **server-side logic**.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **JavaScript**
- **RESTful APIs**
- **Environment-based configuration**
